# simple-linker
This is simple linker. There is no support of dynamic link or
position-independent code.

# How to use
You need gcc to run simple-linker. You should see a message from
`./main-simple-linker.out` when all processes succeeded.
```bash
make
./build.sh
chmod u+x main-simple-linker.out
./main-simple-linker.out
```
